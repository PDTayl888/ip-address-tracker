I first went to the sites that provide the api's for the leaflet map and the ip address tracking. I read about in general and looked at the quickstart guides to get an idea of how they work. I made an account for the ip address and copied the api key. Then I made the basic html skeleton with limited styling. Next I implemented the leaflet map, testing it peiece by piece as I went. Then the same with ipify, the ip address tracking api provider. When they were functioning properly I worked on getting the styling right, including dynamic sizing and formatting for different screens. Finally I implemented accessibility measures.
