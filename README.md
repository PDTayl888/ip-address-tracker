This project is a map that tracks and provides info about any IP address entered in the input field. It displays the IP address itself, the postal address it is located at, the timezone and also the internet service providing it. The map will provide a marker indicating the location the IP address and load at said marker. Although the user is free to zoom in and out and explore any location on the map by scrolling. When the page initially loads you will see the location and info for the IP address of the device in use. Try it now at the link below!

(Jade and Quinn, in case you didn't notice the separate REFLECTION.md file here it is again)

I first went to the sites that provide the api's for the leaflet map and the ip address tracking. I read about in general and looked at the quickstart guides to get an idea of how they work. Then I made the basic html skeleton with limited styling. Next I implemented the leaflet map, testing it peiece by piece as I went. Then the same with ipify, the ip address tracking api provider. When they were functioning properly I worked on getting the styling right, including dynamic sizing and formatting for different screens. Finally I implemented accessibility measures.
